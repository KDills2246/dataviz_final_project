The following is a sample of products created during the _"Data Visualization and Reproducible Research"_ course in Fall 2020.


## Project 01

In the `project_01/` folder you can find a data anlysis performed on US births, primarily focusing on the days of the week by birth count

**Sample data visualization:**

### Moving Forward

As I continue learning new techniques to use in R my next step will be focused around creating an R-Shiny Application and implementing the different visualizations and text mining methods I have learned from this semester
